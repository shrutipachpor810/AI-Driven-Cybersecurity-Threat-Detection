# AI Cybersecurity Threat Detection  ðŸš€

## Project Overview
This project is an **AI-driven cybersecurity threat detection system** that identifies malicious network traffic in real-time. It features a **modern, interactive dashboard** built with **React.js** and **Framer Motion**, showing both live alerts and visualizations of network traffic predictions.  

The system simulates a streaming environment where each network packet is analyzed by a **trained machine learning model** hosted on a Python **FastAPI backend**. Malicious packets are immediately flagged with animated alerts, making it portfolio-ready and demo-friendly.

## Features
- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Simulates incoming network traffic and flags malicious packets instantly.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with React.js and Framer Motion for smooth animations.  
- **Data Visualization:** Bar chart and pie chart showing the distribution of normal vs malicious traffic.  
- **ML Backend:** Uses a trained Random Forest (or Logistic Regression) model served via FastAPI.  
- **Portfolio-Ready:** Fully connected frontend-backend MVP demonstrating cybersecurity AI capabilities.
